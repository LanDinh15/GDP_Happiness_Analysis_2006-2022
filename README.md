## üåê GDP, GDP Per Capita, and Happiness Scores Analysis

### Overview
This Tableau project analyzes the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GDP per capita, and happiness scores across various countries from 2006 to 2022. Using data visualization techniques in Tableau, the project explores how economic indicators correlate with social well-being, identifies trends, disparities, and insights for policymakers. The analysis addresses key questions such as continental GDP trends, population impacts on GDP per capita, and differences in happiness scores based on urbanization.

### Features
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizations including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, pie charts, and maps for exploring GDP, GDP per capita, and happiness data.
- **Filters**: Year, country, continent, and region filters for customized analysis.
- **Forecasting**: Projected GDP trends up to 2026.
- **Key Insights**: Top countries by GDP per capita, correlations between economic metrics and happiness, and population effects.
- **Storytelling**: A Tableau story summarizing answers to analysis questions.

### Prerequisites
To view and interact with this Tableau project, you will need:
- **Tableau Desktop** or **Tableau Reader** (version 2023.1 or later recommended; Tableau Reader is free).
- Basic knowledge of Tableau for navigating workbooks, dashboards, and applying filters.

### Installation
1. Download **Tableau Reader**.
2. Clone or Download the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LanDinh15/Tableau-project.git
```
Alternatively, download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it.
3. Open the Tableau Workbook:
- Locate the `GDP_Happiness_Analysis_2006-2022.twbx` file in the repository.
- Open it in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader.
- The `.twbx` file is packaged with the necessary data sources, so no additional connections are required.

### Data Sources
The project uses the following datasets from Kaggle (packaged within the .twbx file):
- **Countries.csv**: Economic, demographic, and developmental indicators for countries (5106 records, 25 features).
- **World Happiness Report 2022.csv**: Global happiness survey data (146 records, 12 features).
- **WorldPopulation2023.csv**: Population data by country for 2023 (234 records, 12 features).

### Analysis Questions Addressed
- In 2020, which continent had the highest average GDP, and how has its economy trended over time?
- What are the projected GDP trends for the next year?
- What are the top 10 countries in each region with the highest GDP per capita?
- How does large population affect GDP per capita over time across countries?
- Does a high GDP necessarily indicate a high GDP per capita?
- Which countries have low happiness scores?
- Is there a significant difference in happiness scores between highly urbanized and less urbanized countries?

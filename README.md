## üåê GDP, GDP Per Capita, and Happiness Scores Analysis

### Overview
This Tableau project analyzes the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GDP per capita, and happiness scores across various countries from 2006 to 2022. Using data visualization techniques in Tableau, the project explores how economic indicators correlate with social well-being, identifies trends, disparities, and insights for policymakers. The analysis addresses key questions such as continental GDP trends, population impacts on GDP per capita, and differences in happiness scores based on urbanization.
